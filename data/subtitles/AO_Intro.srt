1
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,660
This is Rupture Farms.

2
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,840
They say it's the biggest meat processing plant on Oddworld.

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,000
I used to work here.

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:26,000
Well... I was really a slave.

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,000
...like all the others.

6
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,220
That's me.

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,560
My name is Abe.

8
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,480
I was employee of the year.

9
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,040
...now I'm dead meat.

10
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,700
I crossed the meanest boss in the world...

11
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,500
...Mullock the glukkon.

12
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:12,720
My whole life changed in just one day.

13
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,720
I was working late one night...

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,900
at RuptureFarms.

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,000
We used to make Meech Munchies.

16
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,680
Until the Meeches were through.

17
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,100
We still made Paramite Pies.

18
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,800
And we made some good Scrab Cakes too.

19
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,640
I thought I had a good job.

20
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,380
But that was before I knew...

21
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,720
How we'd make New 'n' Tasty...

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,460
I was still to find.

23
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,920
The truth, it turned out.

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,080
Now that would blow my mind...

25
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,900
The glukkons were scared

26
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,980
'cause profits were grim.

27
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,800
Slig: There they are!

28
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,060
Glukkon: Hey, y'guys, you see that?

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,600
Paramites and Scrabs had been turning out thin.

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,180
Mullock: As you can see, things are going down

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,220
Glukkon: What you gonna do about it, huh?

32
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,480
Molluck: Watch.

33
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,400
But Molluck was cool...

34
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,960
Molluck: Show 'em.
Slig: Allright, boss.

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,620
He had a plan...

36
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,620
Glukkon: But how?

37
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,540
This new kind of meat...

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,580
IT WAS US!

39
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,540
Mullock: We'll chop 'em up.

40
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,860
I just had to escape...

41
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,780
I just had to be free...

42
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,740
and I didn't even know...

43
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,700
I had a destiny.

44
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,440
So...

45
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
Get me outta' here!
