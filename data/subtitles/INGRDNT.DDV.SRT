1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,100
Then I found out the other ingredients

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,800

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,000

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
WHATTTTTT?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
ZAT IS NOT NEAR ENOUGH!

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,800
HOW ARE WE GOING TO ZE FINE RICH FLAVOUR?

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,000

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:25,100
It ain't my fault boss!

11
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,200
We keep running out of Mudokons

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,900
They keep dissapearing

13
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,500
I DON'T NEED EXCUSES!

14
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,100
I NEED TEARS

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,800

00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,900

17
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,500

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
