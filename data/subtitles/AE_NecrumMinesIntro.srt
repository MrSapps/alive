1
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:11,509
This is Necrum.

2
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:16,690
Long ago the Mudokons brought their dead here.

3
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:25,043
That was before the Glukkons started stealing our bones.

4
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:29,905
They used Mudokon slaves to do it.

5
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,196
Blind ones, that couldn't see.

6
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:40,352
The Glukkons didn't want anyone to know, what they were digging up.

7
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:42,690
And no one ever did...

8
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:47,538
Not until the spirits of those bones paid me a visit.

9
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:49,530
<i>It's Abe!</i>

10
00:00:49,687 --> 00:00:50,512
That's me.

11
00:00:51,363 --> 00:00:52,745
My name is Abe.

12
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:57,203
I had just returned from saving 99 Mudokons

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,810
from RuptureFarms.

14
00:01:16,989 --> 00:01:18,810
That's when they came to see me.

15
00:01:19,934 --> 00:01:20,810
<i>Abe!</i>

16
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,738
<i>You're the savior of the Mudokons.</i>

17
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,985
<i>So you gotta help us.</i>

18
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:29,574
<i>The Glukkons are digging up our bones.</i>

19
00:01:29,676 --> 00:01:32,189
<i>You gotta come to Necrum, Abe.</i>

20
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:34,832
<i>Quickly!</i>

21
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:39,389
We had to do something,

22
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,454
so me and some others left to search for Necrum.

23
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:44,450
Our journey started well,

24
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:46,450
we were kind of excited.

25
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:48,450
Abe, you're just the greatest!

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,829
O-Okay.

27
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,820
But by lunchtime,

28
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:55,378
we were getting pretty tired.

29
00:01:56,054 --> 00:01:56,792
Come on!

30
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:57,916
Okay.

31
00:02:01,949 --> 00:02:03,163
How much longer?

32
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,574
By dinner it was unbearable.

33
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:11,901
It's 'cause of you we're in this mess.

34
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,305
This bites.

35
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:15,192
Can I go home?

36
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:21,574
What's that?!
I don't know.
Something big!

37
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,058
Where's that coming from?

38
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:33,734
Hey, look at that.

39
00:02:35,814 --> 00:02:36,549
It's a bone.

40
00:02:37,414 --> 00:02:38,923
I think we're close.

41
00:02:39,476 --> 00:02:41,436
Let's go!
Yeah, let's go.
Let's go.
