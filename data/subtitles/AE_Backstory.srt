00:00:00,285 --> 00:00:03,091
In case you was too cheap to purchase our last game,

2
00:00:03,308 --> 00:00:05,434
let me tell ya a bit about what happened.

3
00:00:05,977 --> 00:00:08,074
It was all about this Abe guy,

4
00:00:08,262 --> 00:00:11,182
that worked in this dumb meat factory, called RuptureFarms.

5
00:00:11,554 --> 00:00:13,485
The place was ran by Glukkons

6
00:00:13,662 --> 00:00:16,348
and the were on the verge of running out of Business.

7
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:19,325
They had already chopped up all the wild creatures

8
00:00:19,485 --> 00:00:23,685
so now they no choice, but to chop up Abe and his buddies too.

9
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:27,771
<i>Oh no, no.</i>

10
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:30,280
We gave Abe the ability to talk!

11
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:33,468
So he could do the right thing and rescue his pals.

12
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:36,251
Hello! Hello! Follow me! Ok!

13
00:00:37,331 --> 00:00:40,188
But some people didn't care about doing the right thing...

14
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:48,302
They thought it was more fun to get them all shot!

15
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:52,222
Or ground up!

16
00:01:00,085 --> 00:01:00,720
Or crushed!

17
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:06,125
Or even beaten!

18
00:01:10,668 --> 00:01:12,125
Needless to say,

19
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,120
this pissed some folks off.

20
00:01:14,182 --> 00:01:17,102
And they didn't lift a finger to help Abe in the end.

21
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:27,868
But if you was halfway decent about it,

22
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,965
and tried your best to save Abe's buddies.

23
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:38,485
The end would have been much better for Abe.

24
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,622
And if you'd like to see it...

25
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,828
You should dish out some cash and go buy this stinking game!

26
00:01:44,777 --> 00:01:46,371
And we gotta eat too you know.
