1
00:00:01,554 --> 00:00:04,045
I had just got past those Slogs.

2
00:00:04,874 --> 00:00:07,137
When the strangest thing I saw...

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,451
A big moon was before me.

4
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:11,891
And it's face...

5
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:17,965
was my paw.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,297
Then I fell...

7
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:25,022
Down a cliff...

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,068
And smashed my head.

9
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:38,548
When some Bigface appeared and said I was dead.

10
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,142
Said our land was changing.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,628
Was imbalanced at best.

12
00:00:46,302 --> 00:00:50,188
He told me, my fate was to rescue the rest.

13
00:00:51,474 --> 00:00:56,474
For Paramites and Scrabs had been sacred once.

14
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,022
But that was before RuptureFarms turned them into lunch.

15
00:01:01,765 --> 00:01:06,222
And they live in the temples, that's where they still nest.

16
00:01:09,108 --> 00:01:11,222
And facing these creatures...

17
00:01:13,937 --> 00:01:16,228
That was my test.
