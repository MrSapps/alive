1
00:00:00,662 --> 00:00:04,600
We're screwed! Pants! I need some pants! Pants!

2
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:10,257
It's not fair!

3
00:00:10,474 --> 00:00:13,205
We had twice ze flavour.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,557
[Screams of agony.]

5
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:26,451
I got out of there just in time;

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,971
and I got the usual reception.

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,605
Abe! It's Abe! It's Abe! It's Abey!

8
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:35,600
It's that Abe guy! It's that Abe guy!

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Abe's ok and he's here to stay!

10
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:40,857
The Mudokons were slowly coming together;

11
00:00:41,657 --> 00:00:45,177
and they were using their skills to build something new.

12
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:45,971
Ah!

13
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:48,097
D'oww!

14
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:50,617
That gotta hurt!

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,000
[Screams of pain.]

16
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:56,102
You'll be fine. It'll all work out.

17
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,560
See? It's all feeling better already.

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,811
Hello. My name is Alf.

19
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:00,988
Hi Alf!

20
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:03,137
I had my first brew

21
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:06,291
while I was with Abe in the desert.

22
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:08,411
Wow.

23
00:01:08,554 --> 00:01:11,760
They were taking things one step at a time.

24
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:12,931
Can I share now?

25
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:14,840
No, just shut up!

26
00:01:15,565 --> 00:01:17,211
All was going well.

27
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:23,665
But we knew there had to be more of us out there.

28
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:26,925
We're screwed...

29
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:33,891
And we were gonna find 'em!

30
00:01:54,714 --> 00:02:00,080
We interrupt this program to bring you this special news bulletin.

31
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:02,337
Rumor Kontrol reports that Abe,

32
00:02:02,337 --> 00:02:06,417
the terrorist mastermind behind the destruction of RuptureFarms,

33
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,051
is also behind the SoulStorm Brewery atrocity.

34
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,937
I hate that guy!

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,857
Stay tuned for more on this story as it develops.
